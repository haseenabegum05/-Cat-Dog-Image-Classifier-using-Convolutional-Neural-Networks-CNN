#Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN
The Cat-Dog Image Classifier project involves using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to develop a model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The project uses a dataset containing labeled cat and dog images for training and testing the mode
